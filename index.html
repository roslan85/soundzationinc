		Unity Secondary School was established in January 2000 with 17 staff and 364 pupils. Mr N Satianathan, who was appointed Principal-designate in July 1999, became the school’s first Principal. The official opening ceremony of the school was held on 15 November 2001. Since the inception of the school, the set of five School Values – Respect, Commitment, Integrity, Compassion and Perseverance” has been established to guide every cohort of Unitians in their character building.<br><br>

On 19 December 2005, Miss Tan Siew Piang took over as the second principal of the school. The vision of developing Unity Secondary School into “A school where students and staff have the Passion to Learn, Drive to Excel and Commitment to Serve” was formulated to provide clear direction for the staff and students to embark on the journey of achieving school excellence.<br><br>

In 2009, the school celebrated its 10th Anniversary with a fun-fair to raise fund for needy students.<br><br>

The current Principal, Mr Chan Ying Yin, who joined the school on 15 December 2009, is the third Principal of the school. A holistic student development framework has been formulated to guide the school in Academic Education and Character and Citizenship Education. With the focus on leadership learning as a key platform for student development, the School Motto was reformulated as “Leading Self, Serving Others; Actualising Self. Inspiring Others”. It espouses the aspiration of every Unitian to be a leader of self and others.<br><br>

In 2010, the school hosted one of the legs of the torch relay of the inaugural Youth Olympic Games.

        We belong to Unity<br>
 United we will stand<br>
 Loyal as we can be to our Nation, our family,<br>

<br><br>
It is we who climb the mountains<br>
 It is we who reach the peak<br>
 As majestic as an eagle<br>
 We will soar to victory<br>
<br><br>
With strength to be strong<br>
 The wisdom to be wise<br>
 The vision we dream of<br>
 We will achieve it all!<br>

We belong to Unity<br>
 United we will stand<br>
 Loyal as we can be to our Nation, our family,<br>

(Written by Chua Wei Jian, Sec 1 student in Year 2000)

<br><br><br> 

The School Flag has the school crest printed on a white background. It represents the honour and pride of the school. Our School Song espouses our aspiration to achieve the school vision together as a team in unity. We pledge our loyalty to our Nation, Family and School. When the School Flag is raised on occasions of achievement and joy, all Unitians will sing the School Song with pride and honour.
